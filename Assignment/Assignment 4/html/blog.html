      <h2>The First Encounter</h2>
      <p class="para1">Just like an ant wants to bite an elephant, to invade into plant host is never an easy task for microbial pathogens. With long time evolution, plants developed several levels defense strategies. Most of the time, healthy plants can effectively restrict microbial pathogens entry, recognize invaded pathogen and promote moderate immune response to reduce pathogen colonization.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, most microbes like fungi and bacteria can only survive and slowly proliferate on the plant surface as epiphytes. For example, on plant leaf, bacteria can often develop into 106 to 107 colonies. The plant surface, dominantly the leaf surface, is not a perfect growth environment for microbes. On plant leaf surface, the temperature and humidity change frequently, and secreted nutrient from plant is always limited.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the epiphytes on leaf surface can be easily washed off by a heavy rain or killed by intensive UV light. In order to survive on leaf surface, some microbes were reported to develop different strategies to "modify" their living conditions. For example, Pseudomonas was found to secrete different toxins to increase the plant nutrient secretion and the lubricity of leaf surface.</p>

      <h2>Battle In Apoplast </h2>
      <p class="para1">Unlike animal and human pathogens, plant microbial pathogens usually habitat in the apoplastic space among plant cells but not invade inside the cell. Therefore, most interactions between microbial pathogens and the host plant take place in the apoplast. For host plant, the task of defense is to efficiently recognize invaded pathogens, and pass the signal of danger to all affected cells and successfully initiate quick and moderate defense response.</p>
      <p>Since plants unlike mammals, do not have specialized defender cells and a somatic adaptive immune system, they mainly rely on the innate immunity of each cell. The pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) distributed on plant cell membrane are in charge of pathogen recognition. PRRs are structurally conserved transmembrane proteins, which always include an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and an intracellular non-arginineâ€“aspartate (non-RD) kinase domain.</p>
